**Portal by Adrianne** is my professional hub — a central index to the projects, studies, and case work that reflect my identity as an **Ethical Prompt Engineer, Data Analyst, and Creative Technologist**.

📄 [View my résumé →](/resume/)

I integrate **visual communication** with **rigorous analysis** and **responsible AI practice**. My work focuses on:
- Designing intuitive, humane experiences and narratives  
- Distilling complex data into clear, actionable insight  
- Implementing generative AI with governance, bias detection, and care

## The Multiverse (Directory)

### 🤖 [Prompted by Adrianne](https://ai.adrianne.io)
My **AI prompt engineering and creative technology portfolio**, where I document case studies, ethical AI reflections, and generative design experiments.  

This space explores how prompts shape AI behavior — with a focus on **responsibility, creativity, and clarity**.

### 📊 [Patterned by Adrianne](https://data.adrianne.io)
My **data analytics and visualization portfolio**, featuring dashboards, Quarto projects, and capstone case studies.  

Here, I transform raw datasets into **narrative-driven insights** — bridging analysis and design.

## 🌷 About Me

Hey there — I’m **Adrianne**!💻✨

I’m a creative technologist, data storyteller, and ethical AI tinkerer who loves blending **design, analytics, and empathy** to build things that actually make sense for people.

I believe in building a *gentler web* — one that’s curious, human-centered, and kinda pastel around the edges. 💕  

Outside of what you see here on *Portal by Adrianne*, I love art, reading, playing video games, watching anime and manga, and listening to J-Pop — they’ve all been a huge source of inspiration for how I create, think, and dream.  I also love bunnies and pandas.

## 🧠 Community & Continuous Learning

I actively participate in online communities centered around AI, creativity, and technology — including **OpenAI Academy** and the **AI Champions Community**, where I continue exploring new approaches to responsible AI and prompt design.  

I’m also a member of groups such as **Tech by Choice**, **Girls Who Code**, and **Girl Develop It**, among others — spaces that encourage collaboration, continuous learning, and representation in tech.
